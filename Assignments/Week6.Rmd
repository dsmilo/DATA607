The data contained in the table above are replicated in a [.csv file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsmilo/DATA607/master/airlines.csv).

###Reading the Data
The data is read into a data frame, using the `check.names = FALSE` option to avoid inserting unnecessary periods in cities with spaces:
```{r read-data}
airlines <- read.table('./airlines.csv', sep = ",", check.names = FALSE, header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

###Cleaning the Data
The first two column names are filled in, and the blank entries in the airline column are filled in:
```{r clean-csv}
names(airlines) <- c('Airline', 'Status', names(airlines)[3:7])
for (i in 1:nrow(airlines)) {
  if (airlines[i, 1] == "") {
    airlines[i, 1] = airlines[i - 1, 1]
  }
}
```

###Tidying the Data
To tidy the data, the frequencies are gathered by destination using `tidyr`.  The blank row is filtered out using `dplyr`:
```{r gather-destinations}
airlines <- airlines %>%
  gather(Destination, Frequency, -Airline, -Status) %>%
  filter(Frequency != "")
```

Flight statuses are renamed for consistency, and then spread out in order to allow for analysis:
```{r spread-status}
airlines$Status[airlines$Status == "on time"] <- "OnTime"
airlines$Status[airlines$Status == "delayed"] <- "Delayed"
airlines <- airlines %>% 
  spread(Status, Frequency)
kable(airlines)
```

###Analyzing the Data
In order to analyze the two airlines' performance, the `mutate` function is used to calculate the total number of flights and use that to calculate the percentage of flights that arrive on time:
```{r on-time-percent}
airlines <- airlines %>% 
  mutate(
    Total = Delayed + OnTime,
    OnTimeRate = OnTime / Total) %>% 
  select(-Delayed, -OnTime)
kable(airlines)
```

The airlines' on-time performance at each of the five airports is visualized using `ggplot2`:
```{r bar-plot, fig.retina=1, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(airlines, aes(x = Airline, y = OnTimeRate, fill = Airline)) + geom_bar(alpha = 0.5, stat = "identity") + facet_wrap(~ Destination, nrow = 1) + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + scale_x_discrete("", breaks = NULL) + scale_y_continuous("") + ggtitle("\n Airline On-Time Performance\n")
```

From this chart, it is clear that Alaska has better on-time performance at each of the five destinations.  To investigate if there is a relationship between on-time performance and volume of flights to a destination:
```{r scatter-plot, fig.retina=1, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(airlines, aes(x = Total, y = OnTimeRate, col = Airline)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + scale_x_continuous("") + scale_y_continuous("") + ggtitle("\n Airline On-Time Performance vs. Flight Volume\n")
```

From this plot, there does not seem to be much relationship between flight volume and on-time performance --- the overall correlation between the two variables is only `r round(cor(airlines$Total, airlines$OnTimeRate), 3)`.
